        Initializes the state of a new congressional district.
        When a new congressional district is initialized, the rolling
        population debt of the last state is used to calculated the new
        state's population bounds.

        `Wesberry v. Sanders (1964)`_ holds:
            The constitutional requirement in Art. I, ยง 2,that Representatives
            be chosen "by the People of the several States" means that, as
            nearly as is practicable, one person's vote in a congressional
            election is to be worth as much as another's.

        `Reynolds v. Sims (1964)`_, which is commonly cited as
        the source of the "one person, one vote" doctrine, adds:
            The federal constitutional requirement that both houses of a state
            legislature must be apportioned on a population basis means that,
            as nearly as practicable, districts be of equal population,
            though mechanical exactness is not required. Somewhat more
            flexibility may be constitutionally permissible for state
            legislative apportionment than for congressional districting.

        In keeping with these rulings, the tolerances on congressional
        district populations are rather tight. Out of the eighteen districts
        in `Pennsylvania's 2018 congressional district plan`_, the lowest
        district population is 686,892, and the highest district population
        is 732,595, constituting a difference of 6.65%. A typical tolerance,
        which we define to be the percent deviation from the target district
        population, is 1%, allowing for a maximum population difference of ~2%
        between the least and most populous districts. As of this writing,
        GerryChain uses `a tolerance of 1% by default`_.

        District populations are not sequentially independent. For instance,
        consider a state with ten districts. If nine districts are allocated
        with populations 1% below the target, the leftover district must
        necessarily have a population 9% above the target.
        To resolve this, we employ a notion of "population debt": if a
        congressional district's population is above the target, we add the
        surplus population (a negative debt) to a running debt, and if a
        district's population is below the target, we add the deficit
        (a positive debt) to that running debt. We then use this debt to
        bound the population of the next congressional district.

        Concretely, consider a state with districts with a tolerance of 2% and
        a population target of 100 people per district. For the first district,
        the population can range from 98 to 102. If we choose the lower bound,
        then we've incurred a debt of 2. If we add that debt to both sides of
        the normal population bounds, we have a range of 100 to 104 for the
        next congressional district. However, we are still bounded by the
        tolerance--the population debt should always make the constraints
        tighter, not looser--so the true range for the second congressional
        district is 100 to 102. This process continues throughout allocation.
